CODE EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------

The implementation is done using Python2.7. Make sure you have the proper python version installed before executing the files.

GENERATING RANDOM SAMPLE FILE:
------------------------------
A sample random file is generated already by the name of 'randomsample.txt'. In case you want to know the procedure of random sample generation, please follow the steps below.

1) Change the directory to the folder where the testcaseGen.py file is present.
2) Execute the file by running the following command: 'python testcaseGen.py'.

This should create a text file by name 'randomsample.txt' in the same folder where the testcaseGen.py is present.
Use this file as the input prolog code to execute the 'prologMapReduce.py'. You may use any other dataset based on the SAME QUERY STRUCTURE and replace the filename of the input file in the main function of the code.


CODE EXECUTION:
----------------
Using Command Prompt (Windows).

1) Change the directory to the folder where the prologMapReduce.py file is present.
2) Execute the file by running the following command: 'python prologMapReduce.py'.

				OR

1) Run the 'prologMapReduce.pyc' python executable file directly by double clicking on it.

This should create a text file by name 'output.txt' in the same folder where the 'prologMapReduce.py' is present. output.txt holds the final output of the entire code execution.
